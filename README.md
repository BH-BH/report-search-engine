# report-search-engine
This repository contains the source code of the Streamlit application: Data Report Search Engine.
You can use this to search cord data reports by collection, title, description or keywords. 

This project was inspired by Sebastian Flores' [Python Chile Talks Searcher](https://pythonchile.streamlit.app/) as mentioned by Streamlit in their [blog](https://blog.streamlit.io/?/).
